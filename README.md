# Project Name: End to End Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis pipeline starting from downloading data from Kaggle using their API (`orders.csv`), cleaning and processing the data with Pandas, loading it into SQL Server, and performing data analysis using SQL queries to answer specific questions.

## Project Structure
- `orders.csv`: Dataset used in the project.
- `Data preparation.ipynb`: Python script for data cleaning and processing.
- `Data analysis with SQL.sql`: SQL scripts for and analysis.

## Steps and Activities
1. **Data Downloading:**
   - Utilized Kaggle API to download the `orders.csv` dataset.

2. **Data Cleaning and Processing:**
   - Used Pandas for cleaning and transforming the data to prepare it for analysis.

3. **Loading Data into SQL Server:**
   - Loaded the processed data into SQL Server for storage and further analysis.

4. **Data Analysis with SQL:**
   - Performed SQL queries to derive insights and answer specific analytical questions about the dataset.
